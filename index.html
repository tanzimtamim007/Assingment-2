                <h2>About Our Team</h2>
                <p>A walk through the history of Barcelona...

                    The first human settlements in Barcelona date back to Neolithic times. The city itself was founded
                    by the Romans who set up a colony called Barcino at the end of the 1st century BC. The colony had
                    some thousand inhabitants and was bounded by a defensive wall, the remains of which can still be
                    seen in the old town.

                    For over 200 years, Barcelona was under Muslim rule, and, following the Christian reconquest, it
                    became a county of the Carolingian Empire and one of the main residences of the court of the Crown
                    of Aragon. The fruitful medieval period established Barcelona's position as the economic and
                    political centre of the Western Mediterranean. The city's Gothic Quarter bears witness to the
                    splendour enjoyed by the city from the 13th to the 15th centuries.

                    From the 15th to 18th centuries Barcelona entered a period of decline, while it struggled to
                    maintain its economic and political independence. This struggle ended in 1714, when the city fell to
                    the Bourbon troops and Catalonia's and Catalans' rights and privileges were suppressed.

                    A period of cultural recovery began in the mid-19th century with the arrival of the development of
                    the textile industry. During this period, which was known as the Renaixença, Catalan regained
                    prominence as a literary language.

                    The 20th century ushered in widespread urban renewal throughout Barcelona city, culminating in its
                    landmark Eixample district, which showcases some of Barcelona's most distinctive Catalan
                    art-nouveau, or modernista, buildings. The Catalan Antoni Gaudí, one of the most eminent architects,
                    designed buildings such as the Casa Milà (known as La Pedrera, the Catalan for stone quarry), the
                    Casa Batlló and the Sagrada Família church, which have become world-famous landmarks.

                    The freedoms achieved during this period were severely restricted during the Civil War in 1936 and
                    the subsequent dictatorship. With the reinstatement of democracy in 1978, Barcelonasociety regained
                    its economic strength and the Catalan language was restored. The city's hosting of the 1992 Olympic
                    Games gave fresh impetus to Barcelona's potential and reaffirmed its status as a major metropolis.
                    In 2004, the Forum of Cultures reclaimed industrial zones to convert them into residential
                    districts. An example of the renewed vigour with which Barcelona is looking towards the 21st century

                    <h3>Team Owner</h3>
                    <p>Make sure people are engaged in setting the goals early on. This practice would most likely be
                        applied differently depending on the size of your team, and how dispersed it is. In a small
                        team, it
                        is easy to engage people in the strategy or goal-setting exercise. In a large organization, this
                        principle will have to be implemented in steps. Step one – would be to get your senior team
                        engaged
                        and aligned. Step two – bring the middle managers on board. And step three – update and include
                        the
                        rest of the team. The application may be different, but the principle of engaging everyone in
                        the
                        goals early on is always relevant. This is because the more people feel listened to and engaged
                        in
                        setting the goals the more they will feel a sense of personal ownership and accountability
                        toward
                        them.</p>

                    <img src="img/Head coach.jpg" alt="">
                    <h3>Head Coach</h3>
                    <p>Promote a culture of open, honest, authentic and courageous communication. The more your people
                        feel
                        they can speak their mind, especially addressing what is not working the more they will
                        naturally
                        gravitate toward feeling and behaving like loyal owners of the business. Regardless of what
                        senior
                        leaders often think, people will only speak up if they believe their leaders genuinely want them
                        to.
                        If you want to deepen ownership and accountability throughout your organization, you have to
                        start
                        with yourself and your senior leaders. You and your leaders need to show that you are open to
                        honest
                        dialogue, including feedback and criticism about yourselves.</p>
